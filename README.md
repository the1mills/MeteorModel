# MeteorModel


"Favor object composition over class inheritance."

-The Gang of Four, "Design Patterns"


"Always bet on JS" - Eric Elliot

Object-literal outperforms everything else

make sure to check for instanceof, isprototypeof, typeof etc


the package was created for maximum usefulness, speed and simplicity

uses the decorator pattern to create a factory object, which outputs a new instance of itself with the data you pass it
